# 0003: Allowing phone numbers to create an account

- **Author**: Oliver Roick, Adrienne Platner
- **Status**: Draft proposal

## Context

Users currently need to register with an email address and confirm this email address via the link provided in a confirmation email. 

We operate in countries where the number of people who have access to email is little. Project managers create both email accounts and platform accounts for users that donâ€™t have an email address. Which is not convenient, time-consuming and introduces security risks, because many might have access to the same account. 

Many more people do have a mobile phone; the phone number can be used to register accounts (instead of using email) and to verify the account. 

## Decision

In addition to emails, we will allow creating accounts by providing a mobile phone number. Users provide either a valid email address or a valid phone number to create an account

**Details**:

- An SMS is sent to the phone including a one-time code that needs to be entered on the site to verify the account. 
- An SMS is sent to the phone including a one-time code to reset the password. The account owner enters the verification code along with the phone number on the platform site to be able to reset the password. 
- A verification code is sent to both the old and the new phone number to change the phone number for the account. To effectively change the number, the account holder must enter both verification codes along with the corresponding phone number on the platform site. The SMS to the old phone number includes a shortlink to lock the account in case of an account breach. The SMS should also provide a point of contact to Cadasta so that we can take necessary action.

## Consequences

By allow users to sign up with a mobile phone number, users who do not have an email address will be able to sign up to the Cadasta platform.
